### Answer

**Becomes more expensive for steel production**

-\> Increase input prices for steel production

-\> Supply curve shifts to the left.

**Reduced the demand for steel products**

-\> Decrease number of buyers for steel production

-\> Demand curve shifts to the left.

**Both curves will shift to the left side,**

so NEW equilibrium point also shift to the left side.

**It is clear that NEW equilibrium quantity will increase**, but price is not.

**Whether equilibrium price increase or not, it depends on how each curves shifts and their elasticity.**

### Answer

We can say that price elasticity, $E_p=\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}=\frac{P}{Q}\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$

Since $P_0=3.46,\;Q_0^D=Q_0^S=2630$ and $\frac{\Delta Q^D}{\Delta P^D}=-266,\;\frac{\Delta Q^S}{\Delta P^S}=240$,

Price elasticity of Demand is $\frac{3.46}{2630}\times -266\approx -0.35$.

Price elasticity of Supply is $\frac{3.46}{2630}\times 240\approx 0.32$
