### Answer2

**1. Increase**

Because of hurricane, input price of coffee bean will increase, supply curve of coffee bean shift to the left.

So, price of coffee beans will increase.

**2. Both increase**

Since price of coffee beans increases, input price of cups of coffee will increase, supply curve of coffee shift to the left.

so, price of cups of coffee will increase and quantity will decrease.

By the question, cups of coffee have inelastic demand.

so, $P\times Q<(P+\Delta P)(Q-\Delta Q)$. Total revenue increases.

**3. Both decrease**

Since cups of coffe and donuts are complements, increase of price of cups of coffee causes decrease of demand of donuts.

So, demand curve of donuts shift to the left, price and quantity will decrease.

Therefore, Total revenue of donuts decrease.

### Answer 3

1. sellers bear more burden of the tax than buyers.

2. buyers bear more burden of the tax than sellers.

3. both participants bear same burden of the tax.

### Answer 4

**1. P=100, Q=200**

$Q^S=Q^D\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;2P=300-P\;\;\therefore P=100,Q=200$

**2. Yes. $P=90\;Q^S=180,\;Q^D=210,\;Shortage=30$**

**3. No. $P=100,\;Q^S=Q^D=200$**

**4. No. $P^*=120,\;Q^{S^*}=Q^{D^*}=180$**

## Question 5

### Answer 5

It depends on elasticity of labor market and ratio of using extra revenues.

If all of extra revenues can be used for workers, it will make workers better. (when demand of labor is not perfect elatic.)

But if just part of extra can be used for workers and demand is more elastic than supply in labor market, it will be different.

Workers bear more burden than firm when tax paid by firms raises,

so it can make workers poor.

## Question 6

**1. Less than 2%**

2% tax-cut of workers makes supply curve shifting to the right in labor market.

So, price of labor(wage) will decrease and its magnitude depends on elasticity of demand curve.

It will be less than 2% when demand curve is not zero elasticity.

If demand is zero elastic, it is exactly 2%.

Since tax-cut makes workers take-home pay rises 2%,

Total change of workers' take-home pay will be less than 2%.

2. More elastic take less benefit.

By explain (1), it depends on elasticity in labor market.

More elastic bear less burden of tax.

It means more elastic take less benefit of tax-cut.
